it's quite painfull sometime but i think i am not working enough to achieve my goals....I must work really hard even harder than i could even imagine....

I have to brush up my technical skill so that they become noteworthy in my cv 
i must start working at it...as hard as i could because somewhere deep inside my heart i believe that whatever happens, happens for the good and there is a reason for everything and its good.....
